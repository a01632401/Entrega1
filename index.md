# Reasons to be a Team:

- We've been partners in several classes and we've worked well together.
- We have similar interests.
- Our abilities compliment each others'.

# Problem Context

Our project will focus on offering a solution to sexual harassment in schools towards female students. Our project will attempt to generate a prototype of a piece of hardware that can efficiently detect sexual harassment or aggresive conducts, document them, and inform the authorities so that they can take action and stop them. Its function would depend on algorythms associated with data bases regarding measurable properties of these actions, such as: the use of harmful language, proximity (distance) between the subjects of analysis, behavioral cues, etc.

## Questions

1. How many pieces should our prototype aim to have?
2. What are the differences between programming a website to programming a machine?
3. How can we guarantee the security of footage and data generated and saved within our prototype?

_Implementation Plan_

**Viability validation**
  - We will determine measurable properties of harassment and violence.
  - We'll design a prototype that fits the needs of the project.
  - The prototype will be tested with third parties that could benefit on implementing this system.
  
**Development**
  - Through feedback, we'll develop the algorythm and system that will allow the propotype to function.
